# Malicious-Encryption

This is the repository for my Senior Capstone research on ransomware.
- You can find the PDF of the paper in the main directory with the title 'Ransomware__State_of_the_Field.pdf' 
- The LaTeX source code can be accessed in the 'src' directory, with 'main.tex'

For this research, we were expected to write a paper on a topic of our choosing, covering the topic's history, technical aspects, and plausible future trends. The intention was not to be entirely comprehensive, but to take a complicated topic and try to deliver it in a top-to-bottom, digestible way. I chose to research ransomware, specifically crypto-ransomware, because it was a topic that I knew almost nothing about at the time and I was beginning to develop an interest in the security side of computing. Ransomware had been a hot topic in the previous few years, and I wanted to see what this type of malware had to offer. I genuinely enjoyed all of the time I spent researching this topic. This research played an integral role in pushing me towards searching for a career in information security.
